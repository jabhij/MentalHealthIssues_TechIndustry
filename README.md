# Mind Matters - Mental Health Issues in Tech Industry

## Project Description
The project analyzes the responses from an annual survey that measures attitudes towards mental health and the frequency of mental health disorders in the tech workplace. The dataset contains different attributes of an employee working in a tech company, such as age, gender, family history, location, etc. Moreover, it has certain columns related to the work culture of the organization each employee is working in, for example, the size of a company, whether it is remote work, benefits the company offers, etc. Our goal here is to predict how inclined each employee is to seek for mental health treatment based on the above-mentioned features. The project will be a combination of predictive and inferential analysis with the use of various statistical methods studied in this class.

## Set of Questions that the Project Seeks to Address
  1. Is there a relationship between an employee’s working conditions and his inclination to seek for help/treatment related to mental health?
  2. To what extent do work conditions impact mental health?
  3. Are there other factors, such as age and family history, which could help explain the correlation between workplace stress and mental health?
  4. What is the correlation between responses to questions about remote work, leave policies, and anonymity with whether individuals have sought treatment for a mental health condition?
  5. Which of the personal features of a person, such as age, gender, location, affect an employee’s mental health the most?
  6. Are there any interaction terms, meaning, is there a combination of features which affect an em- ployee’s mental health? How can we incorporate these complex relationships in our model?
  7. Can we determine the strongest predictors of mental health illness in the workplace using our sta- tistical analysis and inferential summary?
  8. What is our observation of how the frequency of mental health illness and attitudes towards mental health vary by geographic location, company size, remote work, family history, age, gender, and other features?
  9. How accurate is a predictive model that can tell whether an employee will seek mental health treatment?
